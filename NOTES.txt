ban & operator
allocate everything on stack

later do smarter work to allocate registers to local variables
THEN
determine which locals have & applied to them and don't register allocate

--

structs must be stack / heap allocated

size of stack allocated arrays must be proven at compile time

--

.extern name <size in bytes>
tells QtSpim to allocate name to the $gp segment. Then
lw $t0, name

gets translated into

lw $t0, <QtSpim-determined-offset>($gp)

instead of

la $t0, name
lw $t0, 0($t0)
